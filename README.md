# Slope Field Generator
## Description
For this exercise, I created a graphing tool where you can customize the function, axis distance, graph type (Cartesian, Polar, Log-Polar, Log-Log, Hexogonal, and Complex Planes), and colorfully visualize a slope field.

Slope fields are a tool used in differential equations to linearize or fit a function given a number of slopes created from a derivative of the function at any given point. 

This slope field implements custom color schemas that use a new shade of color for similar and unique slopes. 

The function input in the UI reads the equation like a TI-84 calculator "^", so you can input more user-friendly expressions instead of using np.sqrt, for example.
